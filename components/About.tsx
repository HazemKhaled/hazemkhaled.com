            I have always had a knack for technology and working with computers.
            In 2019 I started working with c# to make small games on Unity, then
            I started working with HTML & CSS to make some minor edits on a
            small website that I was operating. What thought was just a few
            small edits turned into love for programming.
          </p> */}
          <p className="py-2 text-gray-600">
            Fascinated with how intricate programming can be I was quickly drawn
            to learn more. I started learning javascript and was even more
            enthused with making websites interactive. I now I started
            freelancing for e-commerce companies on shopify platform. I am now
            spending my time building projects with REACT JS, NEXT JS, and
            learning new technologies.
